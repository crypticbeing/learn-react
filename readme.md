--NEXT js, Gatsby, Remix

--what attachments you got with react library?
//With React library I got React Dom and react native.
//so basically react-dom is for web apps and reactnative is for mobile apps

--What is DOM (Document Object Model?)
//In DOM, we can see the website as an document like when the webpage loads it represent the HTML structure in a tree like model, where we can see text and attributes as an object in the DOM tree, which you can access and manupaulate with javascript using "document.getelementbyID"

--What is npx and npm?
//npm is called as node package manager and npx is called as node package executor

//npx is node package executor and "create-react-app" is a utility or you can say that it is an app.

--npm run start
//we use "npm run start" to start our application. use "run", don't use npm start

--What is package.json?
//contains all the information about react packages and all
//it includes the react scripsm and react domand also include the test packages jest, have the informations of which browser versions supported.

--npm run eject use?
//Running this command will "eject" all the hidden configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel) into your project, making them accessible for direct customization.

--Dev depandencies(package.json file)
//it can't go to the production, its jsut for work

--Web vitals (package,json)
//this will track how is thw performance of your website

--package.lock.json file?
//in this file, a stable version is locked for all the dependencies.

--manifest.json
//this file shows metatext for mobile apps

--what is react DOM?
//react creates his own DOM and Compares his own DOM and browser's DOM that what needs to be change, it can efficiently change that part only.
//So it target the root element which is written in index.html file.
//ReactDOM provides the render() method, which takes a React component and a DOM element to render it into. This is commonly used to display the root component of a React app in the index.html file.

--what is Createroot?
//Same as "createRoot()", but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by ReactDOMServer which is used a event listner. it is a method for ReactDOM.

--root.render
//rendering HTML elements thorough javascript like importing the file in another js and render it like html elements. "<App/>"

--React.StrictMode
//A tool in React that helps developers write better, more resilient code by highlighting potential issues in an application during development. It doesnâ€™t render anything visible on the UI or affect the production build but enables additional checks and warnings to assist in finding issues earlier.

--So what is the benefits when we write HTML through the Javascript?
//it injects the index file into the app file automatically
//in Vitereact the index file directly loads the script file using "script" tag because there is no dependency in the package.
//vite is lightweight because it directly renders the root file.

--What needs to be taken care of?
//when you are making functions in a js file then please start the function name from uppercase letters.

--in vitereact an react application
